# Project Accessibility Report

## Principle of Universal Design

**1. Equitable use:** The game adheres to equitable use by allowing anyone to play, regardless of age, sex, or other 
factors. However, to further improve accessibility for users with disabilities, future enhancements could include 
alternative input methods, such as voice commands for those with physical limitations, and output sound instructions 
for visually impaired users. 

**2. Flexibility in Use:**  The game supports flexibility by offering three levels of difficulty, accommodating players 
with varying abilities and preferences. Additionally, a random difficulty selection option provides more diverse 
gameplay experiences tailored to different users' needs.

**3. Simple and Intuitive Use:** The program’s clean and simple design keeps the main panel easy to navigate. 
Keeping the labels and buttons short and intuitive allow users to interact with the game without needing prior 
instructions, ensuring an intuitive experience for all players.

**4. Perceptible Information:**  The game uses clear contrasts between key information and the background, making it 
more accessible for users with visual sensory impairments. A future enhancement would be adding patterns or textures 
to game stones along with colours to further improving accessibility.

**5. Tolerance for Error:**  The program adheres to tolerance for error by having a cancel button that allows users to 
restart the game at any point. A potential future improvement would be implementing an undo button to help players 
correct unintentional actions during gameplay.

**6. Low Physical Effort:** The game requires minimal physical effort, as most actions involve tapping a button or 
clicking the screen. This makes the program accessible to users with limited physical mobility.

**7. Size and Space for Approach and Use:** The interface is well-spaced, evenly distributed across the screen, and 
the adjustable frame size further enhances usability. A future enhancement could include zoom-in and zoom-out functions,
offering improved accessibility for users with visual impairments.

### Who the program would be marketed towards
The program would be marketed towards casual gamers and families who enjoy strategic and educational games. Mancala’s 
simplicity makes it appealing to children while its strategic depth makes it intriguing for adults. It also has the 
potential to serve as an educational tool for teaching children strategic thinking and planning skills in a fun and 
engaging way.

### Whether or not the program is less likely to be used by a certain demographics
Currently, the program relies solely on visuals, making it less accessible to individuals with visual impairments. 
This could deter potential users who require audio aids or other accommodations. To address this limitation, future 
updates could include sound-based features, like auditory instructions or notifications, and broader accessibility 
options to support users with a wider range of disabilities.
